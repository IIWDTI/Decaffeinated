# Decaffeinated - Commandline tool for turning C1E on or off (ADVANCED USERS)

# Why?

After using HWiNFO64 i noticed small core fluctuations even when "power settings" was set to "Max" settings, i found out turning off C1E in either Bios or Windows, and at the same time forcing the CPU to use 100% in power settings got rid of the problem.

Using this tool will enable a true max power setting.

# How?

C1E Enabled in BIOS: Download the "RunCPUatMax.bat" and the "Decaffeinated.exe", run both of them.

C1E Disabled in BIOS: Only download the "RunCPUatMax.bat".

# Example

Decaffeinated <true, false, status>
